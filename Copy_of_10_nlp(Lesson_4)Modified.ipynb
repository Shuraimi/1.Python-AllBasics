It has a process to automatically get labels from the data, and this task isn't trivial: to properly guess the next word in a sentence, the model will have to develop an understanding of the English (or other) language. Self-supervised learning can also be used in other domains; for instance, see [\"Self-Supervised Learning and Computer Vision\"](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/13/self_supervised/) for an introduction to vision applications. *Self-supervised learning is not usually used for the model that is trained directly, but instead is used for pretraining a model used for transfer learning*."

        "The language model we used in <<chapter_intro>> to classify IMDb reviews was pretrained on Wikipedia. We got great results by directly fine-tuning this language model to a movie review classifier, but with one extra step, we can do even better. The Wikipedia English is slightly different from the IMDb English, so instead of jumping directly to the classifier, we could fine-tune our pretrained language model to the IMDb corpus and then use *that* as the base for our classifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even if our language model knows the basics of the language we are using in the task (e.g., our pretrained model is in English), it helps to get used to the style of the corpus we are targeting. It may be more informal language, or more technical, with new words to learn or different ways of composing sentences. In the case of the IMDb dataset, there will be lots of names of movie directors and actors, and often a less formal style of language than that seen in Wikipedia.\n",

So,**why are we learning how to train a language model in detail**?\n",

        "*One reason*, of course, is that it is helpful to understand the foundations of the models that you are using. But there is another very *practical reason*, which is that you get even better results if you fine-tune the (sequence-based) language model prior to fine-tuning the classification model. For instance, for the IMDb sentiment analysis task, the dataset includes 50,000 additional movie reviews that do not have any positive or negative labels attached. Since there are 25,000 labeled reviews in the training set and 25,000 in the validation set, that makes 100,000 movie reviews altogether. We can use all of these reviews to fine-tune the pretrained language model, which was trained only on Wikipedia articles; this will result in a language model that is particularly good at predicting the next word of a movie review.\n",

The [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) showed that this extra stage of fine-tuning of the language model, prior to transfer learning to a classification task, resulted in significantly better predictions. Using this approach, we have *three stages for transfer learning in NLP*, as summarized in <<ulmfit_process>>."

And, how could time travelers keep going back to the same moments and not keep meeting up with their prior and later selves who were also at those same few minutes in the timeline? It seems there would have been quite a large crowd standing in front of that dinosaur charging.<br /><br />While i can accept the idea of a time wave, i seriously doubt the wave would have caused only a few changes. As the wave passed, all changes that would have happened, would have happened at once during the passage of that wave. So, scratch the idea of the city starting to become overgrown with jungle. And why jungle at all? The location of the city would have still been at the latitude and longitude it was before and would have had vegetation appropriate to its geographic place on Earth.<br /><br />And an endless list of other illogical inanities.<br /><br />Bwahahaha! This flick is a weird combination of some fairly decent production values and totally ridiculous plot holes and factual errors.<br /><br />Too bad. A terrific story idea that was botched up with silly science.<br /><br />Sigh... why, why, why, why?

Word tokenization relies on an assumption that spaces provide a useful separation of components of meaning in a sentence. However, this assumption is not always appropriate. For instance, consider this sentence: 我的名字是郝杰瑞 (\"My name is Jeremy Howard\" in Chinese). That's not going to work very well with a word tokenizer, because there are no spaces in it! Languages like Chinese and Japanese don't use spaces, and in fact they don't even have a well-defined concept of a \"word.\" There are also languages, like Turkish and Hungarian, that can add many subwords together without spaces, creating very long words that include a lot of separate pieces of information.\n",

As with images, it's best to randomize the order of the inputs, so at the beginning of each epoch we will shuffle the entries to make a new stream (we shuffle the order of the documents, not the order of the words inside them, or the texts would not make sense anymore!).\n",

For instance, if the stream has 50,000 tokens and we set a batch size of 10, this will give us 10 mini-streams of 5,000 tokens. What is important is that we preserve the order of the tokens (so from 1 to 5,000 for the first mini-stream, then from 5,001 to 10,000...), because we want the model to read continuous rows of text (as in the preceding example). An `xxbos` token is added at the start of each during preprocessing, so that the model knows when it reads the stream when a new entry is beginning.\n",

        "One thing that's different to previous types we've used in `DataBlock` is that we're not just using the class directly (i.e., `TextBlock(...)`, but instead are calling a *class method*. A class method is a Python method that, as the name suggests, belongs to a *class* rather than an *object*. (Be sure to search online for more information about class methods if you're not familiar with them, since they're commonly used in many Python libraries and applications; we've used them a few times previously in the book, but haven't called attention to them.) The reason that `TextBlock` is special is that setting up the numericalizer's vocab can take a long time (we have to read and tokenize every document to get the vocab). To be as efficient as possible it performs a few optimizations:\n",

This should sound familiar: we had the same issue with images. In that case, we used cropping, padding, and/or squishing to make all the inputs the same size. Cropping might not be a good idea for documents, because it seems likely we'd remove some key information (having said that, the same issue is true for images, and we use cropping there; data augmentation hasn't been well explored for NLP yet, so perhaps there are actually opportunities to use cropping in NLP too!).

Additionally, to avoid memory issues and improve performance, we will batch together texts that are roughly the same lengths (with some shuffling for the training set). We do this by (approximately, for the training set) sorting the documents by length prior to each epoch. The result of this is that the documents collated into a single batch will tend to be of similar lengths. We won't pad every batch to the same size, but will instead use the size of the largest document in each batch as the target size. (It is possible to do something similar with images, which is especially useful for irregularly sized rectangular images, but at the time of writing no library provides good support for this yet, and there aren't any papers covering it.

        "1. Name three different approaches to tokenization.\n",
        ">1. Word tokenization - splitting a sentence into words using language specific rules\n",
        ">2. Subword tokenization - splitting sentence into most commonly occuring group of letters or subwords🤔 or splitting the words of a sentence into commonly occuring substrings called as subwords. *These can be part of words, whole words or characters depending upon their frequency in training corpus.*\n",
        ">3. Characters tokenization - splitting a sentence into characters\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is `xxbos`?\n",
        ">`xxbos` is a special token which stands for Beginning of stream. It indicates the beginning of sentence and also helps model to understand that it has to forget the previous part and focus on this part(present).\n",
        "\n",
        "1. List four rules that fastai applies to text during tokenization.❌\n",
        ">Here are the rules:-\n",
        ">- `fix_html` - replaces HTML tags with one's meaningful to the model or are readable.\n",
        "> -`replace_rep` - replaces the characters that are repeated more than 2 times with a special token `xxrep` followed by the number of times then the character. The same for `replace_wrep`\n",
        "> -`replace_maj` - replaces the words which begin with a capital letter with a special token `xxmaj` followed by the lowercase version of that character.\n",
        "> -`lowercase` - lowercase all text and add a special token at the beginning and the end.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Why are repeated characters replaced with a token showing the number of repetitions and the character that's repeated?🤔❌\n",
        ">The repeated characters are replaced to reduce the number of tokens required to represent the sentence and also it is more efficient to represent the repeated chars and also give info to model. *The repeated can have different meaning when compared to single character. By replacing the repeated characters with a special token, the model's embedding matrix can encode info about general concepts such as repeated characters rather than requiring separate token for every number of repetition for every character.*\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is \"numericalization\"?\n",
        ">Numericalization is the process of converting tokens into numbers using the vocab. *i.e. mapping tokens to integers *\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Why might there be words that are replaced with the \"unknown word\" token?\n",
        ">There are two reasons:-\n",
        ">1. When the `max_vocab` is set to a number, the extra words other than those in the vocab are replaced by \"unknown word\" token\n",
        ">2. When `min_freq` is set to a number, any word that is repeated < that number of times, it is replaced by \"unknown word\".\n",

        "1. Why do we need padding for text classification? Why don't we need it for language modeling?🤔✅(note this down)\n",
        ">We need padding for text classification because cropping and squishing the docs is not a good idea. All the docs in a batch should be of the same length when we want to arrange them in a batch. So what we do is, at each epoch, we shuffle and sort the docs in a batch and pad the smaller length docs in a batch so that it becomes of the same size as the largest doc in batch and therefore we can arrange them into a single tensor.<br>We don't need it for language modelling because here we concatenate the docs and then break them down into tokens and then numericalize to get the vocab.\n",

        "1. What does an embedding matrix for NLP contain? What is its shape?\n",
        ">The embedding matrix contains words along rows represented as vector form and number of dimensions as columns.*It contains vector representations of all tokens in the vocabulary.<br>It's shape is number of tokens in vocab × number of dimensions/embedding size.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is \"perplexity\"?\n",
        ">Exponential of cross entropy loss function and *is the commonly used metric in NLP for language models.*\n",

        "1. What is \"gradual unfreezing\"?\n",
        ">Gradual unfreezing is a process of unfreezing the layers of the NN few at a time so that they can be trained. Only these layers of NN's weights can be updated and the rest remain unchanged. Gradually unfreezing few layers at a time improves performance of good to a great extent.\n",
